    <h1>Animal Shelter</h1>
    <p>
      You have been hired by a local animal shelter to develop an online
      ordering system for future pet owners. The animal shelter doesn't let
      future pet owners choose specific pets, they can only choose the type of
      pet being: Dog, Cat, Rabbit, Fox. You must show all of the available pet
      types and give future pet owners a way to add them to the cart. Show the
      future pet owners their cart and allow them to remove the last pet they
      added.
